       <a name="mission"><h2>Our Mission</h2></a>
       <p>Our mission is to provide Portlandians of all ages with access to high-quality, artisanal umbrellas. For too long Portlandians have been forced to brave the rain with flimsy, unimpressive, reasonably-priced umbrellas. We all know how this usually turns out: in a word, badly. More specifically, this ends with an inverted umbrella, bent out of shape, and you, soaking wet, looking like an idiot. We aim to change this situation. We cannot, must not, and shall not stand for it any longer.</p>

       <img class="displayed" src="our-founders.jpg"/>
       <p>Our founders have over 20 years experience in the umbrella industry, ranging from the design, manufacture, and distribution of these magnificent objects. They began their careers with the illustrious Cambridge Umbrella Company, but quickly began struggling to reconcile their love of the craft with the proliferation of shoddy umbrellas in the greater Portland area. In the fall of 2015, they resolved to create Artisanal Umbrellas for the Good.</p>
